== Implementation
Most of the plugin code is marked as @CompileStatic.

=== AuditLogEventListener
The Audit Logging plugin registers a PersistenceEventListener (`AuditLogListener`) bean per datasource, which listens to GORM events.

=== StampEventListener
The plugin registers a separate StampEventListener that responds to validate events. Ideally, we would stamp when an insert or update event occurs, but since the attributes are non-null by default, we need to populate them before the default validation is triggered.

=== Plugin Descriptor
The Plugin Descriptor (AuditLogListenerGrailsPlugin) configures the plugin during startup.

 * Configures the plugin either by default values - see DefaultAuditLogConfig.groovy - or by user configured settings.
 * Registers a PersistenceEventListener bean per datasource

=== Auditable trait
Enabling auditing on a Domain class is done by implementing the `Auditable` trait.

=== Stampable trait
Enabling stamping on a Domain class is done by implementing the `Stampable` trait.
This trait adds the properties dateCreated, lastUpdated, createdBy, lastUpdatedBy
to the domain class.
